-- tables

Postgres datatypes - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.html
Mockaroo data generator - https://www.mockaroo.com/

create table people (
  id int, 
  first_name varchar(50),
  last_name varchar(50)
);

\d - show all tables
\dt - shows table without sequences
\d [tableName] - describes the table
drop table [tableName] - drops table

create table people (
  id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  age int NOT NULL,
  email varchar(150)
);

(bigserial is used for autoincrementing)

insert into people (first_name, last_name, age, email) values ('yael', 'brown', 34, 'yael@yaelbrown.com');
insert into people (first_name, last_name, age, email) values ('Steve', 'Smith', 30, 'steve@stevesmith.com');



-- tables queries

select first_name from people ORDER BY asc; - display names in ascending ORDER
  DSC - for descending

select distinct first_name from people - Display unique entries for the defined column

select 1 = 1; #t - comparison operator
  select 1 = 2; #f 
  <> - not equal operator

select * from people LIMIT 10; - limits to first 10 records

select * from people OFFSET 5; - does not display first 5 rows

select * from people where first_name IN ('bill','steve','mike') - IN keyword lets you select multiple values instead of using multiple Where's. 

select * from people where first_name BETWEEN 'a' AND 'm' - only show values between a-m. 

select * from people where first_name like '%el' - wildcard matching
  ilike - ignores key
  '___%h' - underscores mean, anything that has (3) chars but ends with h, return those

select * from people where first_name COUNT(*) group by first_name - display count of different names






-- joins

INNER JOINS - is the intersection of two tables. 
  if item exists in both tables it will be returned

SELECT * FROM person JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id; 

\x - expanded view, makes the results look pretty

LEFT JOIN - Return records from both tables and all items in (left) table that does not have a relationship with the foreign table.

SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON car.id = person.car_id;



-- Deletes

no cascades in postgres? 
  have to delete the left key, or assign it as NULL

cascade is bad practice.
